## 10.1.2

Two ends of the array can be used as the two tops of the stack. 
Stack 1 top: 0
Stack 2 top: n
When the end of one Stack is adjacent to the end of the other, we are full. 
See bistack.py.

enqueue(Q, x):
    if Q.head = 1 and Q.tail == Q.length:
        return 'overflow'
    Q[Q.tail] = x
    if Q.tail == Q.length
        Q.tail = 1
    else Q.tail = Q.tail + 1

dequeue(Q):
    if Q.head == Q.tail:
        return 'underflow'
    x = Q[Q.head]
    if Q.head == Q.length:
        Q.head = 1

    return x

## 10.1.6
```
S1, S2

If you want to enqueue:
    push x O(1)
If you want to dequeue:
    pop everything from one stack (let's say S1) and push them to S2. O(n)
    pop from S2. O(1)
```

## 10.1.7
```
Q1, Q2
If you want to push:
    dequeue all elements in Q1 O(n) and enqueue them in Q2
    add x to Q1 (empty)
    dequeue all from Q2 and enqueue in Q1 O(n)

If you want to pop:
    dequeue Q1 until only one element is left O(n)


In 10.1.6 I chose a 'hard dequeue' and in 10.1.7 a hard push. I could have also seen it as a 'hard enqueue' and a 'hard pop'.

## 10.2.1
```
INSERT: 
Yes: 
    Q.head.next = x
    Q.head = x
DELETE: 
No, we have to go through the queue to fetch x, so it'll be O(n). 
```
## 10.2.2
```
push(x):
    L.head.next = x
    L.head = x
pop:
    return L.head
#### Implement this
```
## 10.2.3
```
enqueue(x): 
    x.next = L.tail
    L.tail = x
dequeue():
    return L.head

#### Implement this

If k is assigned to the sentinel's key, we can skip xâ‰ L.nil check.
