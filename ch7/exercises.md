```
A = 13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11
(1) i=0, p=1, j=1: 13 > 11; j++
(2) i=0, p=1, j=2: 19 > 11; j++
(3) i=0, p=1, j=3: 9 < 11; i++ and exchange A[1] with A[3] so A = 9, 19, 13, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11 and j++
(4) i=1, p=1, j=4: 5 < 11; i++ and exchange A[2] with A[4] so A = 9, 5, 13, 19, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11 and j++ 
(5) i=2, p=1, j=5: 12 > 11; j++
(6) i=2, p=1, j=6: 8 < 11; i++ and exchange A[3] with A[6] so A = 9, 5, 8, 19, 12, 13, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11 and j++ 
(7) i=3, p=1, j=7: 7 < 11; i++ and exchange A[4] with A[7] so A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 12, 13, 19, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11 and j++ 
(8) i=4, p=1, j=8: 4 < 11; i++ and exchange A[5] with A[8] so A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 13, 19, 12, 21, 2, 6, 11 and j++ 
(9) i=5, p=1, j=9: 21 > 11; j++
(10) i=5, p=1, j=10: 2 < 11; i++ and exchange A[6] with A[10] so A =  9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, 19, 12, 21, 13, 6, 11 and j++ 
(10) i=6, p=1, j=11: 6 < 11; i++ and exchange A[7] with A[11] so A =  9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, 6, 12, 21, 13, 19, 11 and j++ 
(11) swap A[i+1] with A[r] so A =  9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, 6, 11, 12, 21, 13, 19
